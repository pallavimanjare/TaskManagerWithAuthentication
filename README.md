# TaskManagerWithAuthentication
# Problem Statement:
In today’s world, individuals often need to keep track of various tasks in a structured
way. You are tasked with building a Task Manager that allows users to manage their
tasks. The system should include user authentication, meaning each user has to log
in with a username and password. Once logged in, users can create, view, update,
and delete their tasks. Each user’s tasks should be stored separately, and only the
authenticated user can access their tasks.

# Objectives:
1. Design and implement a user authentication system (login and registration)
2. Create a task management system that allows users to:
a. Add, view, mark as completed, and delete tasks
3. Use file handling to store user credentials and tasks persistently
4. Create an interactive menu-driven interface to manage tasks
